> :warning: This project is now outdated. The new PingBypass proxy [here](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/3arthh4ck) is much more powerful. E.g. it allows you to leave the proxy connected to the server and join through it at a later point.

# PingBypassClient

PingBypassClient or 3arthh4ck (at least a dumbed down version of it) is a Client that allows you to connect to PingBypass (https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/PingBypass) proxies.

## Installation
- Install Minecraft 1.12.2 and forge for that version, then drop the jar into your mods folder.

## Usage
- The clients prefix is + and, especially if you managed to setup PingBypass, the commandsystem should be self explanatory.
- Typing "+S-AutoCrystal toggle" should be all you need after you connected to PingBypass

## Configs
TBD
